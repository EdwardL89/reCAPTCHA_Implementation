# reCAPTCHA Android App Implementation
This repository contains an Android app written in Kotlin that implements reCAPTCHA verification using the SafetyNet API. 

## Description
The home screen will have a "Launch reCAPTCHA" button that, when pressed, begins the SafetyNet API calls. This will commence the reCAPTCHA verification process and will show a window to let you select images that meet a certain criteria. If this test is passed, the screen notifies you and presents the option to repeat the process through the "Restart" button.
